      { q: "I've never used crypto. Is this complicated?", a: "It feels new at first but it's simpler than it looks. The hardest part is buying the crypto — once you have it, sending a payment is just \"open app → send → scan QR → confirm\". Follow the step-by-step guides above and you'll be done in under 10 minutes." },
      { q: "Why Dash and Bitcoin specifically?", a: "Because they are genuinely decentralized. No government, no bank, no corporation controls them. Bitcoin has been running for 15+ years without anyone being able to shut it down. Dash was designed for fast, private everyday payments. USDC/USDT are convenient but issued by companies — technically a company could freeze USDC. Dash and Bitcoin can't be frozen by anyone." },
      { q: "What's the difference between USDC and USDT?", a: "Both are digital dollars worth exactly $1 each. We use USDT on BNB Smart Chain (BSC) as the quick-pay option — it works natively with Binance and MetaMask. If using Binance, tap Wallets → Withdraw → USDT → BNB Smart Chain and paste the address. USDC is also accepted via NowPayments if you prefer it. Both are stable, both give you full crypto privacy." },
      { q: "What if my crypto payment doesn't confirm?", a: "If you sent the payment but your account wasn't activated after 30 minutes, contact us at pnptv.app/contact. Send your transaction ID (a long string of letters/numbers your wallet gives you after sending). We can recover it manually." },
      { q: "Is my identity hidden when I pay with crypto?", a: "Yes. Crypto transactions are pseudonymous — recorded on a public blockchain but not tied to your real name. We don't ask for your name when you pay. We never see who you are beyond your PNPtv account." },
      { q: "Can I pay with other cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, Litecoin, etc.)?", a: "We accept many coins via NowPayments — including ETH, LTC, XMR (Monero), and more. On the checkout page you can select your coin. We highlight Dash, Bitcoin, USDC, and USDT because they're the most practical for our community." },
      { q: "Is the 20% discount applied automatically?", a: "Yes. For most yearly and lifetime plans, the crypto discount is applied automatically when you select any crypto payment method. The Lifetime PRIME $100 offer is already at its fixed crypto price." },
      { q: "What is BTCPay Server?", a: "BTCPay Server is the checkout system we use for Dash payments. It's open-source software we run on our own server — no third party sees your payment data. We self-host it for maximum privacy." },
      { q: "Can I get a refund on a crypto payment?", a: "Yes. Our refund policy applies to all payments including crypto. You have 24 hours from payment to request a refund. Requests are reviewed and processed within 72 hours. Contact us at pnptv.app/contact with your transaction ID and we'll take care of it." },

    faqTitle: "Preguntas frecuentes",
    faq: [
      { q: "Nunca he usado cripto. ¿Es complicado?", a: "Al principio se siente nuevo pero es más simple de lo que parece. La parte más difícil es comprar el cripto — una vez que lo tienes, enviar un pago es solo \"abrir app → enviar → escanear QR → confirmar\". Sigue las guías paso a paso y estarás listo en menos de 10 minutos." },
      { q: "¿Por qué Dash y Bitcoin específicamente?", a: "Porque son genuinamente descentralizados. Ningún gobierno, ningún banco, ninguna empresa los controla. Bitcoin lleva más de 15 años funcionando sin que nadie haya podido apagarlo. Dash fue diseñado para pagos privados y rápidos del día a día. USDC/USDT son convenientes pero los emiten empresas — técnicamente podrían congelarlos. Dash y Bitcoin no pueden ser congelados por nadie." },
      { q: "¿Cuál es la diferencia entre USDC y USDT?", a: "Ambos son dólares digitales que valen exactamente $1 cada uno. Usamos USDT en BNB Smart Chain (BSC) como opción de pago rápido — funciona nativamente con Binance y MetaMask. Si usas Binance, ve a Billeteras → Retirar → USDT → BNB Smart Chain y pega la dirección. USDC también es aceptado a través de NowPayments si lo prefieres. Ambos son estables y ambos te dan privacidad total." },
      { q: "¿Qué pasa si mi pago en cripto no se confirma?", a: "Si enviaste el pago pero tu cuenta no se activó después de 30 minutos, contáctanos en pnptv.app/contact. Envía tu ID de transacción (una cadena larga de letras/números que tu wallet te da después de enviar). Podemos recuperarlo manualmente." },
      { q: "¿Mi identidad está oculta cuando pago con cripto?", a: "Sí. Las transacciones cripto son seudónimas — se registran en una blockchain pública pero no están vinculadas a tu nombre real. No pedimos tu nombre cuando pagas. Nunca vemos quién eres más allá de tu cuenta en PNPtv." },
      { q: "¿Puedo pagar con otras criptomonedas (Ethereum, Litecoin, etc.)?", a: "Aceptamos muchas monedas a través de NowPayments — incluyendo ETH, LTC, XMR (Monero) y más. En la página de checkout puedes seleccionar tu moneda." },
      { q: "¿El descuento se aplica automáticamente?", a: "Sí. En la mayoría de planes anuales y lifetime, el descuento cripto se aplica automáticamente. La oferta Lifetime PRIME de $100 ya está a su precio cripto fijo." },
      { q: "¿Qué es BTCPay Server?", a: "Es el sistema de checkout que usamos para pagos con Dash. Software de código abierto que ejecutamos en nuestro propio servidor — ningún tercero ve tus datos de pago." },
      { q: "¿Puedo pedir un reembolso si pagué con cripto?", a: "Sí. Nuestra política de reembolsos aplica a todos los pagos, incluyendo cripto. Tienes 24 horas desde el pago para solicitar un reembolso. Las solicitudes se revisan y procesan dentro de las 72 horas. Contáctanos en pnptv.app/contact con tu ID de transacción y lo resolvemos." },
